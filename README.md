## Summary

As we are approaching to design the gameplay as simple as possible for the player to comprehend but still keep the classic play style so we created the Dungeon mode which consists of three phases.

## Rule

Before getting started, players must choose one of six characters on the character selection screen in order to start the game.

The rules of the game are simple, the player needs to place bombs to kill all the monsters without being touched by them.

We developed dropping-item features with the purpose of boosting the character stats whenever the monsters are killed or blocks are destroyed and they drop some power-up items randomly, then he/she picks up one of those potions to gain power for the character.
